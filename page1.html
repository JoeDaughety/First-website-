    <h2>My first dirty heads show!</h2>
    <p>
        The dirty heads were founded in 2006 and i like to belive ive been a fan since day one. In 2008 they were really
        hitting the ground running
        and doing any show they could get... Which lead them to playing at the opening of a Cali taco chain that was
        making the debut in HTX!
        It was an accoustic set, and they only played infront of about 25 people, but its one of those shows that meant
        so
        much to me back then,
        and really set the tone for a music genere that would change my life forever.

    <h2>First trip to Caliroots</h2>
    <p>
        My First trip to cali roots was one of the best trips of my life. I was probably around 21 and it was the first
        time i took a trip on my own with some friends.
        We were broke and coulent afford a plane ticket and hotel room so me and two of my best friends packed up my
        truck with food, drinks, and our camping gear and left for caliroots late on a Tuesday evening. We were leaving
        from Houston Texas and were looking at about a 24 hour trip to get to Los Angeles... our first pit stop to get
        some rest before the show.
        The three of us took turns driving and switched every 4-5 hours, we were all young and ready to get there so we
        made really great time and made it to LA in just about 24 hours. We had some friends that lived in a one bedroom
        apartment and the 3 of us crashed in their living room and got some rest.
        Waking up Thursday morning we were all stoked an ready to get back on the road. We were about 4 hours from the
        monteray fair grounds. Getting there was easy, but once we got to the fair grounds we could hardly contain the
        excitment!
        We were camping so we got to work on building out our area for the next three days... Our three man tent was all
        we had and we
        couldnt have been happier. The next three days were full of some of the best days of music any of us had
        experienced up to taht point in our lives.
        We made friends with strangers and loved every waking moment of it. Alot of the details are a bit of a blur...
        but id give anything to go back in time and
        relive our first trip to cali roots!

    <h2>Red Rocks</h2>
    <p>
        My first show at Red Rocks... Man was it special. Ive wanted to go to Red Rocks for as long as I can remember,
        and two months
        after my 30th birthday I finally had the change. My girlfriend Aly and I were planning a vacation in Key stone
        Colorado, and everything
        lined up perfectly. We landed in Denver on Saturday and our show at RR was that Sunday. The stars of the show
        that night were hands down
        Rebelution, but the moment ill remember for the rest of my life is watching the Bassist of Steel Pulse RUN
        through the crowd from the first row
        to the very last and taking with picutes with everyone he could along the way. It was so awesome to see somone
        that loved what he did as much as Amkak Tafari did that night.
        I was lucky enough to snag a picute with him, its a little blury, but I wouldnt change a thing.
